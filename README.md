- 👋 Hi, I’m @helenolicurgo
- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps.
- 🌱 I’m currently leaning about AWS Cloud services, administration and security. And I recently brush up my moves with Linux and I'm back in business.
- :star2: Statistics for Data Analysis? I got you convert (in numbers) with a lot of experience under my belt in Advanced Statistical Analysis 
- :star: I adore Python (intermediate) and know a very basic of Java (and I'm not good at all with this since college). SQL? Only the most basic skills for DB access and manipulation. And, of course the useful Excel... Who doesn’t? Oh, by the way, LINUX RULES!
- :mortar_board: I'm undergraduate in Social Sciences: don't let it fools you, we need a LOT of complex Statistics to analyze society and PROPOSE models.
- :mortar_board: I do not finish my undergraduation in Physics and I have no plans too in any foreseeable future. But I keep all the good tools from this time in my utility belt.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Oh gosh, I don't have a slice of idea here. Let's see what the future holds...
- 📫 You can reach me at my personal web site: https://www.heleno.net.br/ and check some of my photos :camera:, because I'm not only code .
