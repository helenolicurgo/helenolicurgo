- 👋 Hi, I’m @helenolicurgo
- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps and some FullStack, but I prefer to be full of snacks.
- 🌱 I’m currently leaning about AWS Cloud services, administration and security. And I recently brush up my moves with Linux and I'm back in business.
- 🌟 I have a Scrum Certification. Yeah... :smirk:
- 🌟 And some OPSWAT certifications at Associate-level (“May I see your badge, officer?”).
- ⭐ Statistics for Data Analysis? I got you convert (in numbers) with a lot of experience under my belt in Advanced Statistical Analysis.
- ⭐ I know a basic of Java (and I'm not good at all with this since college).
- ⭐ SQL? Only the most basic skills for DB access and manipulation.
- ⭐ Of course the useful Excel... Who doesn’t?
- 🌟 Oh, by the way, LINUX RULES!
- 🎓 I'm undergraduate in Social Sciences: don't let it fools you, we need a LOT of complex Statistics to analyze society and PROPOSE models.
- 🎓 I do not finish my undergraduation in Physics and I have no plans too in any foreseeable future. But I keep all the good tools from this time in my utility belt 🦇.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Oh gosh, I don't have a slice of idea here. Let's see what the future holds...
- 📫 You can reach me at my personal web site: https://www.heleno.net.br/ and check some of my photos :camera:, because I'm not only code .
