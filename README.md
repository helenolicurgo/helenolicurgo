- 👋 Hi, I’m @helenolicurgo
- 👀 I’m interested in App Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning Java.
- :star: I already know (and love) Python (intermediate), Statistics for Data Analysis (with a lot of experience under my belt in Advanced Statistical Analysis) and a little of SQL (only the most basic skills for DB access and manipulation). And, of course the useful Excel... Who doesn’t?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Oh gosh, I don't have a slice of idea here. Let's see what the future holds...
- 📫 You can reach me by my personal web site: https://www.heleno.net.br/ and check some of my photos, because I'm not only code.
