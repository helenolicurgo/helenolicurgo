- 👋 Hi, I’m @helenolicurgo
- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps.
- 🌱 I’m currently leaning about AWS Cloud services, administration and security. And I recently brush up my moves with Linux and I'm back in business.
- :star: I already know (and love) Python (intermediate) and a very basic of Java (and I'm not good at all), Statistics for Data Analysis (with a lot of experience under my belt in Advanced Statistical Analysis) and a little of SQL (only the most basic skills for DB access and manipulation). And, of course the useful Excel... Who doesn’t? Oh, by the way, LINUX RULES!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Oh gosh, I don't have a slice of idea here. Let's see what the future holds...
- 📫 You can reach me at my personal web site: https://www.heleno.net.br/ and check some of my photos, because I'm not only code.
